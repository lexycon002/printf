# PROJECT ON C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
## This project was carried out in pairs betweeen

- **Hammad Olamilekan** *and*
- **Godwin Moses Chukwudi**

 **What is printf**

 - **printf** is a function in the **C standard library** that is used to print formatted output to the console or other output stream.
 - It takes a format string and a variable number of arguments, and outputs the formatted string to the console or other output stream.
 - The format string can contain conversion specifiers that define how the arguments are to be printed, such as **%s** for a **string**, **%d** for a **signed integer**, **%f** for a **floating-point** number, and so on.
 - The **printf** function returns the number of characters printed, excluding the null terminator.

## The general requirement of the project are;

 - The editors allowed are: vi, vim, emacs
 - All the files must be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
 - All the files must end with a new line
 - A README.md file must be present at the root of the folder of the project.
 - The code should use the Betty style. It must be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
 - The use of global variables are not allowed
 - There should be no more than 5 functions per file
 - The main.c file can be used to test the functions, but there isn't a need to push them to the repo (if done it wonâ€™t be taken into account. The already provided main.c files will be use for compilation.
 - The prototypes of all the functions must be included in the header file called main.h
 - The header file must be pushed.
 - The header files should be include guarded.
